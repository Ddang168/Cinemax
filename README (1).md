## Cinemax Data Analysis Project 

This analysis project aims to provide insights into CineMax, a fictional movie rental company that uses the sample sakila database from MySQL. Using Power BI to model the data up to 3NF and analyze and identify trends, understand the data and make reccomendations to 
increase rentals.

Data source - I have uploaded the sample database "sakila" onto the repository or if you have MySQL already you can install it on there.

### Tools
Power BI - Data visualisation, data modelling and data normalization

### Data Preparation
In the initial stage, I prepared the data in Power BI, the following tasks I did were:
- Data modelling - Normalization and relationships ensure that updates, deletions, or insertions in one table are correctly reflected across the data model without causing data inconsistencies.
- Formatting the data - Setting the right data type for each column
- Managing the relationships - Setting the right relationships between the tables to ensure accurate aggregations and calculations

### Results/Findings
1. India is our most popular country between both stores 
2. Rentals increase during the summer season
3. An upwards trend in the total sales

### Reccomendations
Based on the analysis I reccomend:
 - Implement loyalty programs, bundles to keep customer churn rate during the low periods
 - Invest more into sports films as demand increases
 - Instead of generic monthly discounts, analyze customer purchasing behavior to tailor discounts to specific customer segments or products that are underperforming.
 - Develop targeted marketing campaigns around holidays or events that align with customer interests to capitalize on seasonal trends.
